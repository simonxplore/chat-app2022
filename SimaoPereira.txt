My name is Sim√£o Pereira and I'm a exchange student from Lisbon, Portugal. I'm studying Audiovisual and Multimedia
in my homeschool, but I came here to learn more about Visual and Web/App design. I have been doing a lot of online
courses in this areas because it's something that I really like. 

Besides all of this, I have been a photographer for the past 4 years, but recently stopped doing it professionaly 
and decided to keep it just as an hobbie because it's something that I really like to do for fun on my instagram
(@simonxplore).

I had two previous courses in Web Development, in the first one we learned HTML and CSS and then, in the second, we
learned Javascript and PhP. In the beggining I thought this course was just Web/App design but I found out now that
it's actually Development which is very scary because I'm not that used to code. However, I'm excited to learn more
about REACT. 

In the future I would like to be either a Ux or a Ui Designer! It's a subject that I really like to study and learn
more about.
